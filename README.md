PROJECT TITLE: Arduino Speedometer
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: detecting speed of horizontal movement
VERSION or DATE: 2.0

The Speedometer measures the time passed from the passing of the first sensor to the second, and calculates the speed of the movement between the sensors.
All the calculations, coding, soldering, designing, and wiring of this project were done by me.
